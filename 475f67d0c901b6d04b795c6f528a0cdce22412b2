Task: Update LVM Configuration
Summary: Rebuilt the LVMCluster configuration to use 'optionalPaths' in 'deviceSelector' to support heterogeneous hardware (Node 2/3 vs Node 4).
Files:
- infrastructure/storage/lvms/base/lvmcluster.yaml
- infrastructure/storage/lvms/base/kustomization.yaml
- argocd-apps/cluster-lvms.yaml
Why: The previous configuration failed on Node 2 and 3 because the device path list was interpreted strictly. Using 'optionalPaths' allows the operator to pick the valid path for each node.
