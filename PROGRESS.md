- [2025-12-22]: Switched `rdt-client` provider to TorBox to resolve Zurg/Real-Debrid sync and symlink issues.
- [2025-12-22]: Updated `zurg` configuration to improve compatibility with `rdt-client` (retain names, auto-delete RARs) for legacy library access.
- [2025-12-22]: Confirmed `rclone-torbox` mount is active and populating new downloads in Plex.
- [2025-12-22]: **CRITICAL FIX**: Pinned `rdt-client`, `sonarr`, `radarr`, and `plex` to `wow-ocp-node4`.
    - **Reason**: FUSE mounts on NFS PVCs were failing to propagate correctly on Node 3 (empty directory listing), causing "File Not Found" errors in `rdt-client`.
    - **Result**: Co-locating all apps on Node 4 ensures they share the same functional mount namespace. Symlinks are now created correctly and immediately visible to Plex.
- [2025-12-22]: Verified end-to-end flow with "Peacemaker S02E05" via TorBox -> rdt-client (Node 4) -> Symlink -> Plex (Node 4).
