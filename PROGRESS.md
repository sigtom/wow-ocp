- [2025-12-22]: Switched `rdt-client` provider to TorBox to resolve Zurg/Real-Debrid sync and symlink issues.
- [2025-12-22]: Updated `zurg` configuration to improve compatibility with `rdt-client` (retain names, auto-delete RARs) for legacy library access.
- [2025-12-22]: Confirmed `rclone-torbox` mount is active and populating new downloads in Plex.
- [2025-12-22]: **CRITICAL FIX**: Pinned `rdt-client`, `sonarr`, `radarr`, and `plex` to `wow-ocp-node4`.
- [2025-12-22]: Verified end-to-end flow with "Peacemaker S02E05" via TorBox -> rdt-client (Node 4) -> Symlink -> Plex (Node 4).
- [2025-12-23]: **ARCHITECTURAL UPGRADE**: Migrated entire media stack to Sidecar Pattern.
    - **Change**: Added `rclone-zurg` and `rclone-torbox` containers to every deployment (Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, Bazarr, Sabnzbd, Riven, Rdt-client).
    - **Result**: Resolved FUSE/NFS mount propagation issues. Apps no longer need to be pinned to a single node.
    - **Optimization**: Replaced hard `nodeSelector` with `nodeAffinity` (preferred) for Node 2 and 3 to utilize 10G NICs and superior CPU resources.
    - **Outcome**: Verified cross-pod mount consistency and successful deployment to Node 3 via ArgoCD.
