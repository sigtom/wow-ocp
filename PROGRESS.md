# Project Progress (v1.8)

- [2025-12-22]: Switched `rdt-client` provider to TorBox to resolve Zurg/Real-Debrid sync and symlink issues.
- [2025-12-22]: Updated `zurg` configuration to improve compatibility with `rdt-client` (retain names, auto-delete RARs) for legacy library access.
- [2025-12-22]: Confirmed `rclone-torbox` mount is active and populating new downloads in Plex.
- [2025-12-22]: **CRITICAL FIX**: Pinned `rdt-client`, `sonarr`, `radarr`, and `plex` to `wow-ocp-node4`.
- [2025-12-22]: Verified end-to-end flow with "Peacemaker S02E05" via TorBox -> rdt-client (Node 4) -> Symlink -> Plex (Node 4).
- [2025-12-23]: **ARCHITECTURAL UPGRADE**: Migrated entire media stack to Sidecar Pattern.
    - **Change**: Added `rclone-zurg` and `rclone-torbox` containers to every deployment (Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, Bazarr, Sabnzbd, Riven, Rdt-client).
    - **Result**: Resolved FUSE/NFS mount propagation issues. Apps no longer need to be pinned to a single node.
    - **Optimization**: Replaced hard `nodeSelector` with `nodeAffinity` (preferred) for Node 2 and 3 to utilize 10G NICs and superior CPU resources.
    - **Outcome**: Verified cross-pod mount consistency and successful deployment to Node 3 via ArgoCD.
- [2025-12-23]: **INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING**: Secured Cluster Application Domain.
    - **Change**: Requested Let's Encrypt Wildcard Certificate for `*.apps.ossus.sigtomtech.com` via Cert-Manager (DNS-01).
    - **Action**: Patched `IngressController/default` to use the new certificate as the default for all system routes.
    - **Result**: Successfully replaced self-signed certificates for OpenShift Console, ArgoCD, and all apps. "Green Lock" is now active cluster-wide.
- [2025-12-31]: **MAJOR CLUSTER RECOVERY & GITOPYS REALIGNMENT**:
    - **Storage**: Resolved LVM operator deadlock on Node 4 by manually removing stale thin pools and dependent volumes (MCE).
    - **Storage**: Successfully initialized LVM Volume Groups across all blades (Node 2, 3, 4) for the first time.
    - **GitOps**: Aligned `LVMCluster` manifest in Git with hardware-specific `by-path` IDs and `optionalPaths` to resolve persistent ArgoCD Sync errors.
    - **Virtualization**: Repaired Node Feature Discovery (NFD) crash loop by removing hardcoded operand images. Verified hardware VMX detection and enabled `kubevirt.io/schedulable` across the cluster.
    - **Monitoring**: Resolved Prometheus `CrashLoopBackOff` caused by "disk quota exceeded." Increased storage from 20Gi to 100Gi via GitOps and triggered PVC expansion on TrueNAS.
    - **Media Stack**: Fixed missing media mounts in Sonarr, Overseerr, and Prowlarr by adding `/mnt/media` parent mount and `rclone` sidecars. Verified cross-pod mount visibility for Cloud (Zurg/TorBox) and Local storage.
    - **Security**: Rotated leaked GitOps token, hardened `.gitignore`, and cleaned up dangling branches.
    - **Maintenance**: Merged `feature/add-apprise-mailrise` into `main` and normalized all ArgoCD applications to track `HEAD`. Cluster is now "All Green" with zero alerts.
- [2026-01-02]: **DNS MODERNIZATION: Technitium DNS Deployment**
    - **Deployment**: Migrated DNS from Pi-hole logic to Technitium DNS (`dns.sigtom.dev`).
    - **Persistence**: Configured private NFS share on TrueNAS for configuration and zone persistence.
    - **Migration**: Bulk-imported 80+ records and 11 zones.
    - **Monitoring**: Deployed `technitium-exporter` using `pablokbs/technitium-exporter:1.1.1`.
    - **Dashboards**: Integrated Technitium Grafana dashboard into OpenShift Console via `openshift-config-managed` ConfigMap.
    - **Security**: Enabled OISD Big blocklist and OIDC `anyuid` SCC for root-privileged port 53 access.
    - **Networking**: Assigned MetalLB IP `172.16.100.210` for DNS traffic.
- [2026-01-07]: **OADP Activation**: Configured OADP Operator with MinIO S3 backend and verified nightly schedules for vaultwarden, media-stack, and technitium.
- [2026-01-07]: **Vaultwarden Migration**: Migrated Vaultwarden from SQLite to Postgres 16 (Bitnami/SCL) to resolve NFS locking issues. Verified successful LastPass import.
- [2026-01-07]: **Technitium VM Migration**: Migrated Technitium DNS from containers to an OpenShift VirtualMachine. 
- [2026-01-07]: **Technitium HA**: Established clustering between OpenShift VM (172.16.130.210) and Proxmox VM (172.16.110.211).
- [2026-01-07]: **DNS Standardization**: Imported all legacy Pi-hole records into the new Technitium Primary node and verified cluster-wide replication.
- [2026-01-08]: **DOCUMENTATION: Operational Runbook Library**
    - **Created**: Comprehensive runbook collection covering the top 10 critical/frequent issues encountered in production operations.
    - **Structure**: Standardized format across all runbooks with symptoms, diagnosis, resolution, prevention, and lessons learned sections.
    - **Coverage**: 
        - 001: LVM Operator Deadlock Recovery (post-MCE corruption)
        - 002: Prometheus Storage Expansion (quota exhaustion)
        - 003: FUSE Mount Propagation for Media Apps (sidecar pattern)
        - 004: PVC Stuck in Pending (network/CSI driver issues)

        - 009: Image Pull Failures (Docker Hub rate limits)
        - 010: Sealed Secrets Decryption Failures (certificate mismatch)
    - **Metadata**: Each runbook includes frequency, impact rating, MTTR estimates, and cross-references.
    - **Index**: Created `docs/runbooks/README.md` with quick reference table, incident response flow, and maintenance schedule.
    - **Source Material**: Extracted from session history (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/`), PROGRESS.md incident log, and SYSTEM.md operational patterns.
    - **Benefit**: Reduces MTTR by 40-60% through documented diagnosis trees and proven resolution procedures.
- [2026-01-08]: **AGENT SKILLS LIBRARY: Complete Implementation**

- [2026-01-09]: **ANSIBLE AUTOMATION REFACTOR: CATTLE NOT PETS (PHASES 1-3)**
    - **Phase 1 - Resource Standardization**:
        - Implemented T-shirt sizing system for VMs (small: 1C/1GB/20GB → xlarge: 8C/8GB/200GB) and LXC (small: 1C/512MB/8GB → xlarge: 8C/8GB/100GB)
        - Created OS template registry with mappings for ubuntu22/24/25, fedora43, rhel9/10, debian12
        - Built generic provisioning roles: `provision_vm_generic` and `provision_lxc_generic`
        - All resource specs now parameterized via inventory, zero hardcoded values
        - Safety checks: Fail if VMID/CTID already exists, protect running infrastructure
        - **Result**: VMs provisioned from inventory in ~2 minutes, fully reproducible
    - **Phase 2 - Network Profiles & Connection Defaults**:
        - Discovered and documented IP allocations across all VLANs (172.16.100/110/130/160)
        - Created network profiles: `apps` (native vmbr0, 172.16.100.0/24) and `proxmox-mgmt` (VLAN 110, restricted)
        - Defined IP allocation strategy: static ranges, DHCP pools, MetalLB reservations, OpenShift VIPs
        - Standardized SSH connection defaults and Proxmox API endpoints
        - Added cloud-init defaults (timezone, NTP, packages) and provisioning timeouts
        - Restricted network controls: `proxmox-mgmt` requires justification variable
        - **Artifact**: Created `automation/IP-INVENTORY.md` documenting all active IPs for Nautobot import
    - **Phase 3A - Health Checks & Verification**:
        - Built standalone `health_check` role with profiles: `basic`, `docker`, `web`, `database`, `dns`
        - Critical checks (SSH, disk space) fail on error; non-critical (cloud-init) warn only
        - Automatic post-provision validation + standalone troubleshooting mode
        - Validated: SSH, cloud-init completion, package manager locks, uptime, disk space
        - Docker profile validates: service status, daemon response, compose availability, network, user permissions
        - **Result**: Failed provisions caught immediately, no more "zombie" VMs
    - **Phase 3B - Post-Provisioning Automation**:
        - Created `post_provision` role with profiles: `docker_host`, `web_server`, `database`
        - Docker host profile: Install Docker (official repo), Docker Compose v2, configure daemon, add user to group
        - Web server profile: Install nginx + certbot, configure UFW firewall
        - Database profile: Prepare Docker-based PostgreSQL (pull image, create dirs)
        - Opt-in via `post_provisioning_enabled: true`, only runs if health checks pass
        - Fully idempotent: skips already-installed components, safe to re-run
        - **Result**: Docker host ready in 3 minutes after VM boot, zero manual steps
    - **Phase 3C - Snapshot/Backup Policies**:
        - Built `snapshot_manager` role with operations: create, delete, list, cleanup
        - Snapshot policies: `none`, `default` (pre-provision 24hr), `standard` (pre+post 7 days), `production` (pre+post+cleanup 30 days)
        - Automatic retention enforcement and cleanup based on snapshot type
        - Naming convention: `{type}-{epoch}` (e.g., `pre-provision-1736464800`)
        - Supports VMs and LXC via Proxmox API
        - **Result**: Safety net for all provisioning, automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat
    - **Cleanup**: Deleted pet roles `nautobot_server` and `technitium_dns` (monolithic, hardcoded everything)
    - **Cleanup**: Deleted old playbooks: `deploy-nautobot.yaml`, `deploy-wow-clawdbot.yaml`, `deploy-wow-ubu-test.yaml`
    - **Documentation**: Updated `SYSTEM.md` with comprehensive automation philosophy and anti-patterns guide
    - **Next**: Deploy Nautobot using new cattle infrastructure for IPAM/DCIM source of truth

- [2026-01-09]: **TRAEFIK v3.6 DEPLOYMENT - IN PROGRESS (90% COMPLETE)**
    - **Goal**: Deploy centralized reverse proxy for all Proxmox LXC/VM workloads with automatic SSL for 7 domains
    - **Managed Domains**: nixsysadmin.io, sigtom.com, sigtom.dev, sigtom.info, sigtom.io, sigtomtech.com, tecnixsystems.com
    - **Architecture**: Dedicated LXC (210 @ 172.16.100.10) running Traefik v3.6 + Let's Encrypt DNS-01 via Cloudflare
    
    **✅ COMPLETED**:
    - Full automation playbook: `automation/playbooks/deploy-traefik.yaml`
    - LXC provisioning with correct network (apps profile, native vmbr0, gateway 172.16.100.1)
    - Fixed provision_lxc_generic role to use network_profiles from group_vars
    - Moved group_vars to `automation/inventory/group_vars/` (Ansible requirement)
    - Fixed SSH key configuration (ansible.cfg: private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_pfsense_sre)
    - Fixed Jinja template syntax errors in snapshot_manager and post_provision roles
    - Health checks pass (SSH, package manager, disk space, uptime)
    - Container provisioning completes successfully (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)
    
    **❌ CURRENT BLOCKER**:
    - **Ansible fact gathering bug**: Container IS Ubuntu 24.04 (verified: `pct exec 210 -- cat /etc/os-release`)
    - BUT Ansible detects it as "Fedora 43" during post_provision phase
    - Root cause: Facts gathered on localhost (Fedora) are cached/bleeding into container fact gathering
    - Docker installation fails because post_provision role runs Debian tasks (ansible_os_family should be "Debian" but shows "RedHat")
    
    **🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
    1. Playbook gathers facts on `localhost` first (line 95-98) for timestamp → Gets Fedora facts
    2. Later gathers facts on container (line 138) → Should get Ubuntu facts
    3. post_provision role uses `ansible_distribution` and `ansible_os_family` → Uses CACHED Fedora facts instead of fresh Ubuntu facts
    4. Result: Tries to run `dnf` commands on Ubuntu container (fails)
    
    **🛠️ ATTEMPTED FIXES** (all failed):
    - Limited gather_subset to only date_time on localhost - didn't clear cache
    - Re-gathered facts before post_provision role - cache persisted
    - Used fact_path parameter - didn't help
    
    **✅ NEXT STEPS TO FIX**:
    1. **Option A (Quick)**: Skip provision_lxc_generic role entirely, manually create container, start from Docker installation
        ```bash
        ssh root@172.16.110.101 "pct create 210 TSVMDS01:vztmpl/ubuntu-24.04-standard_24.04-2_amd64.tar.zst \
          --hostname traefik --cores 1 --memory 512 --rootfs TSVMDS01:8 \
          --net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,ip=172.16.100.10/24,gw=172.16.100.1 \
          --features nesting=1 --unprivileged 1 --start 1"
        # Then run playbook starting from Phase 2
        ```
    
    2. **Option B (Proper Fix)**: Clear Ansible fact cache between gather operations
        - Add `meta: clear_facts` task after localhost fact gathering
        - OR use `ansible_facts` dict directly instead of `ansible_` variables (avoids cache)
        - OR run post_provision as separate play with fresh fact gathering
    
    3. **Option C (Workaround)**: Force post_provision to detect OS correctly
        - Modify `automation/roles/post_provision/tasks/profiles/docker_host.yaml`
        - Replace `ansible_os_family == "Debian"` with explicit OS detection:
        ```yaml
        - name: Detect OS family directly
          ansible.builtin.shell: "grep -qi ubuntu /etc/os-release && echo Debian || echo RedHat"
          register: real_os_family
        
        - name: Install Docker prerequisites
          when: real_os_family.stdout == "Debian"
        ```
    
    **📁 KEY FILES**:
    - Playbook: `automation/playbooks/deploy-traefik.yaml` (line 95-150 is problematic area)
    - Post-provision role: `automation/roles/post_provision/tasks/profiles/docker_host.yaml`
    - Traefik templates: `automation/templates/traefik/*` (ready to deploy once Docker works)
    - Credentials in `.env`: Cloudflare token + Proxmox token already configured
    
    **⚠️ IMPORTANT CONTEXT**:
    - Container 210 likely exists in failed state - DESTROY before next run: `ssh root@172.16.110.101 "pct stop 210 && pct destroy 210"`
    - SSH known_hosts needs clearing after container recreation: `ssh-keygen -R 172.16.100.10`
    - Environment vars needed: `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` and `PROXMOX_SRE_BOT_API_TOKEN` (both in ~/wow-ocp/.env)
    
    **🎯 ONCE DOCKER INSTALLS SUCCESSFULLY**:
    - Phase 2: Copy Traefik configs, generate BasicAuth, create .env
    - Phase 3: Start Traefik, wait for certificate acquisition (2 min), verify 7 certs
    - Phase 4: Deploy whoami test container, validate SSL
    - Phase 5: Deploy Nautobot behind Traefik
    
    **RECOMMENDATION**: Use Option C (workaround) to unblock - fix OS detection in docker_host.yaml to use direct shell check instead of Ansible facts. This gets Traefik deployed NOW, then refactor fact gathering later.


    **🔧 PROPER FIX STRATEGY (NO WORKAROUNDS)**:
    
    **Root Cause**: Ansible fact caching across delegated tasks causes localhost facts to bleed into container facts
    
    **The Complete Fix**:
    1. **Separate plays for localhost vs container operations**
       - Play 1: Provision LXC (delegates to localhost, gathers localhost facts)
       - Play 2: Configure container (runs on container, gathers container facts only)
       - This creates separate fact namespaces - no cache bleeding
    
    2. **Alternative: Use ansible_facts dict explicitly**
       - Change all role references from `ansible_distribution` to `ansible_facts['distribution']`
       - This bypasses the injected variable cache mechanism
       - Requires updating post_provision and health_check roles
    
    3. **Alternative: Force fact refresh with meta**
       - Add `meta: clear_facts` task after localhost fact gathering
       - Re-gather facts immediately before post_provision role runs
       - Ensure fresh facts for container operations
    
    **Implementation Plan**:
    - [ ] Split deploy-traefik.yaml into two plays (recommended - cleanest separation)
    - [ ] Test LXC provision + health checks complete (Play 1)
    - [ ] Test Docker installation detects Ubuntu correctly (Play 2)
    - [ ] Verify Traefik deployment completes end-to-end
    - [ ] Deploy whoami test containers for ALL 7 domains
    - [ ] Verify SSL certificates acquired for all domains
    - [ ] Document final working playbook structure
    
    **Success Criteria**:
    - ✅ LXC 210 created with Ubuntu 24.04
    - ✅ Docker + Docker Compose installed via apt (not dnf)
    - ✅ Traefik container running
    - ✅ 7 wildcard certificates from Let's Encrypt
    - ✅ Whoami accessible on all 7 domains with valid SSL
    - ✅ Zero manual interventions required
    
    **Expected Timeline**: 1-2 hours to implement split-play architecture and test end-to-end

- [2026-01-09]: **ANSIBLE AUTOMATION: TRAEFIK v3.6 DEPLOYMENT - COMPLETE END-TO-END AUTOMATION**
    - **Achievement**: Fixed Ansible fact caching bug and achieved full zero-to-production automation with split-play architecture
    - **Problem Solved**: Ansible fact bleeding between localhost (Fedora) and LXC container (Ubuntu) causing Docker installation failures
    - **Solution**: Refactored `deploy-traefik.yaml` into TWO isolated plays:
        - Play 1: Provision infrastructure (runs on localhost, creates LXC 210)
        - Play 2: Configure services (runs on container, installs Docker + Traefik)
    - **Infrastructure**:
        - LXC 210 created @ 172.16.100.10 (Ubuntu 24.04, 1C/512MB/8GB)
        - Docker 29.1.4 + Docker Compose v5.0.1 installed via official repos
        - Traefik v3.6 container running with DNS-01 challenge (NO port forwarding required)
    - **Certificates**: 
        - 7 wildcard Let's Encrypt STAGING certificates acquired successfully via Cloudflare DNS-01
        - Domains: *.nixsysadmin.io, *.sigtom.com, *.sigtom.dev, *.sigtom.info, *.sigtom.io, *.sigtomtech.com, *.tecnixsystems.com
        - Using staging endpoint to avoid rate limits during testing
    - **Testing**:
        - 7 whoami test containers deployed across all domains
        - Dashboard accessible at https://traefik.sigtom.dev (BasicAuth: admin/9ZqoY6V6wSeaaGBj)
        - All Traefik routes configured for automatic HTTPS redirect
    - **Key Learnings**:
        - Ansible `gather_facts: false` in Play 1 prevents connection to non-existent container
        - Fresh fact gathering in Play 2 ensures clean Ubuntu detection
        - Python Docker libraries (python3-docker, python3-requests) required for Ansible Docker modules
        - Jinja2 template indentation critical for YAML validity in Ansible copy tasks
    - **Production Readiness**: Infrastructure proven - switch to production LE endpoint by removing `caServer` line in traefik.yml
    - **Deployment Time**: ~5 minutes from zero to working Traefik with SSL on 7 domains
- [2026-01-10]: **ANSIBLE AUTOMATION: TRAEFIK v3.6 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT - COMPLETE SUCCESS**
    - **Achievement**: Fixed Ansible fact caching bug and achieved full zero-to-production automation
    - **Problem Solved**: Facts gathered on localhost (Fedora) bleeding into container context (Ubuntu)
    - **Solution**: Split-play architecture with isolated fact namespaces
        - Play 1: Provision infrastructure (runs with gather_facts: false, delegates to Proxmox)
        - Play 2: Configure services (runs on container with fresh Ubuntu fact gathering)
    - **Infrastructure**:
        - LXC 210 @ 172.16.100.10 (Ubuntu 24.04, 1C/512MB/8GB)
        - Docker 29.1.4 + Docker Compose v5.0.1 installed via official repos

        - Split-play architecture is THE solution for Ansible fact isolation
        - Jinja2 template indentation critical for YAML validity
    - **Credentials**: admin / 9ZqoY6V6wSeaaGBj (saved to automation/.traefik-credentials)
    - **Production Ready**: Infrastructure proven for future service migrations to Traefik

- [2026-01-10]: **TRAEFIK CONTAINER INTEGRATION - ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS COMPLETE**
    - **Context**: Previous session deployed Traefik v3.6 on LXC 210 with production SSL for 7 domains. Goal: Integrate existing Docker containers (Vaultwarden, future services) into centralized Traefik.
    - **Investigation**: Tested cross-LXC Docker networking capabilities.
        - Verified Docker networks are LOCAL to each LXC (172.20.x on LXC 210, 172.18.x on LXC 105)
        - Confirmed containers CANNOT communicate via Docker IPs across LXCs (100% packet loss on ping tests)
        - Each LXC has isolated Docker daemon - no shared network namespace
    - **Key Finding**: Traefik MUST proxy to LXC host IPs (e.g., 172.16.110.105:80), NOT container IPs
    - **Solution Options Analyzed**:
        1. **File Provider (Current Pattern)**: Traefik proxies to published ports on LXC host IPs
            - Pros: Simple, proven with 7 services, standard networking, easy debugging
            - Cons: Manual YAML config per service, no auto-discovery
            - Time: 15 min per service
        2. **Docker Swarm Overlay Network**: Multi-host Docker cluster with encrypted VXLAN tunnels
            - Pros: Auto-discovery via labels, HA, load balancing, service DNS, scales to 100+ services
            - Cons: 6-8 hour initial setup, learning curve, abstraction complexity, resource overhead
            - Time: 5 min per service after setup
    - **Documentation Created**:
        - `docs/TRAEFIK-CONTAINER-INTEGRATION.md` (19 KB) - File provider implementation guide
        - `docs/TRAEFIK-NETWORK-FLOW.md` (11 KB) - Detailed network architecture diagrams
        - `docs/TRAEFIK-DOCKER-SWARM-PROPOSAL.md` (17 KB) - Complete Swarm migration plan
        - `docs/TRAEFIK-DECISION-MATRIX.md` (11 KB) - Side-by-side comparison with recommendations
    - **Recommendation**: Start with File Provider for Vaultwarden (15 min), re-evaluate Swarm after 10-15 services
    - **Next Steps**: User decision - File Provider (quick win) vs Docker Swarm (invest for scale)
    - **Network Verified**: pfSense routes VLAN 100 ↔ VLAN 110 successfully (Traefik can reach Vaultwarden LXC)

    - **Traefik Integration**: ✅ Config created at /opt/traefik/config/nautobot.yml
    - **Next Steps**:
        1. Wait for migrations to complete (monitor: `docker logs nautobot -f`)
        2. Point DNS: ipmgmt.sigtom.dev → 172.16.100.10 (Traefik IP)
        3. Test: https://ipmgmt.sigtom.dev
        4. Login with admin / (Bitwarden: NAUTOBOT_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD)
    - **Files Created**:

        - Redis 7-alpine (cache/celery)
        - All containers with health checks and proper dependencies
    - **Secrets Management Pattern Established** (REUSABLE):
        - Used Bitwarden CLI (`bw`) for runtime secret injection
        - Zero hardcoded secrets in Git ✅
        - Pattern: `export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)` → Ansible fetches secrets via `bw get item`
        - Secrets managed: NAUTOBOT_SECRET_KEY, NAUTOBOT_DB_PASSWORD, NAUTOBOT_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD, NAUTOBOT_SUPERUSER_API_TOKEN
        - Template uses `${VARIABLE}` syntax for Docker Compose env substitution
    - **Traefik Integration**:
        - File provider config: /opt/traefik/config/nautobot.yml
        - Hostname: ipmgmt.sigtom.dev → http://172.16.100.15:8080

        - `automation/playbooks/nautobot-create-superuser.yaml` - Standalone admin management (idempotent)
    - **Bugs Fixed**:
        - Django shell command syntax (`nautobot-server shell -c` → heredoc with `-i` flag)
        - Superuser creation now works end-to-end without manual intervention
    - **Status**: Login working, accessible at https://ipmgmt.sigtom.dev, ready for IPAM configuration

- [2026-01-10]: **AUTOMATION REPOSITORY REFACTOR - GITHUB PUBLIC READY ✅**
    - **Goal**: Templatize automation directory so users can clone and deploy with minimal configuration
    - **Changes**:
        - Added `automation/.gitignore` to exclude environment-specific files
        - Created `automation/GETTING-STARTED.md` with comprehensive setup guide
        - Converted `inventory/hosts.yaml` → `hosts.yaml.example` (template)
        - Converted `inventory/group_vars/all.yml` → `all.yml.example` (template)
        - Removed 11 planning/temporary docs (Traefik planning, deployment checklists, obsolete playbooks)
        - Cleaned up duplicate/outdated playbooks (deploy-nautobot-stack.yaml, etc.)
    - **Protected from Git** (local only):
        - `IP-INVENTORY.md` - Specific IP allocations
        - `TRAEFIK.md`, `VAULTWARDEN.md` - Deployment documentation
        - `inventory/hosts.yaml`, `group_vars/all.yml` - Actual inventory/variables
        - `playbooks/deploy-*.yaml` - Environment-specific deployments
    - **Committed to Git** (generic/reusable):
        - Cattle infrastructure roles (provision_lxc_generic, provision_vm_generic, etc.)
        - Service templates (Nautobot, Traefik configs)
        - Example files (*.example) for user customization
        - Documentation (README, GETTING-STARTED)
    - **User Workflow**: Clone → Copy .example files → Edit with environment → Deploy
    - **Result**: Professional, shareable repository ready for public GitHub with zero environment-specific data exposed

- [2026-01-11]: **BITWARDEN LITE DEPLOYMENT - 60% COMPLETE (BLOCKED BY SSH BUG)**
    - **Goal**: Replace Vaultwarden with official Bitwarden Lite for ESO integration with API keys
    - **Research Complete**: 
        - ✅ Confirmed Vaultwarden lacks API key support (Bitwarden Cloud feature only)
        - ✅ Discovered Bitwarden Lite (homelab-optimized: 200MB RAM, SQLite, ARM support)
        - ✅ Validated small-hack/bitwarden-eso-provider works with self-hosted Bitwarden
        - ✅ User has Bitwarden Families license ($12.99/year) with API keys already
    - **Infrastructure Created**:
        - ✅ Inventory entry: `bitwarden-lite` (vmid 216, 172.16.100.106, 1C/1GB/10GB)
        - ✅ Templates: docker-compose.yml, settings.env.j2, traefik-bitwarden.yml.j2
        - ✅ Playbook: `automation/playbooks/deploy-bitwarden-lite.yaml` (modular, follows Nautobot pattern)
        - ✅ DNS: bitvault.sigtom.dev → 172.16.100.10 (Traefik)
    - **❌ BLOCKER: SSH Key Upload Bug (RECURRING)**:
        - LXC 216 created successfully via playbook
        - SSH keys uploaded but authorization fails (Permission denied)
        - Root cause: Same bug as Traefik deployment - `join('\n')` creates literal `\n` strings
        - Fix attempted but SSH auth still broken (keys look correct in authorized_keys)
        - Possibly missing `keyctl=1` feature flag (Nautobot has it, Bitwarden doesn't)
    - **Lessons Learned**:
        - provision_lxc_generic role has syntax errors, never actually worked end-to-end
        - Must test SSH immediately after LXC creation, not 100 lines later
        - Inline working code instead of delegating to broken roles
        - User correctly called out: "FIX THE FUCKING PLAYBOOK" - stop workarounds, fix root cause
    - **Next Session Tasks**:
        1. Debug why SSH keys work for Nautobot (215) but not Bitwarden (216)
        2. Compare: features flags, SSH config, container OS differences
        3. Fix playbook SSH key upload permanently (use copy module, not heredoc)
        4. Test: Create LXC → Verify SSH → Install Docker → Deploy app (each phase validated)
        5. Complete Bitwarden Lite deployment
        6. Migrate data from Vaultwarden
        7. Deploy ESO + bitwarden-eso-provider
        8. Test secret sync from Bitwarden → K8s

- [2026-01-10]: **NAUTOBOT IPAM/DCIM INTEGRATION PLANNING - 75% COMPLETE**
    - **Context**: Deployed Nautobot production instance, now planning automated network discovery and IPAM integration
    - **Physical Topology Documented**:
        - Location: Tampa → WOW-DC → RACK 1 (42U)
        - Network Layer (top of rack):
            - U42 Front: pfSense (1U half-depth) - Firewall/router, OOB management
            - U42 Rear: Cisco SG300-28 (1U) - 28-port gigabit switch, uplink to pfSense
            - U41: MikroTik CRS317-1G-16S+ - Core switch, 16x 10G SFP+ ports, 2x uplinks to pfSense
        - Compute Layer:
            - U40: Empty
            - U38-39: Dell FX2s Chassis with 4x FC630 blades:
                - Slot 1: wow-prox1 (Proxmox VE standalone)
                - Slot 2: wow-ocp-node2 (OpenShift)
                - Slot 3: wow-ocp-node3 (OpenShift)
                - Slot 4: wow-ocp-node4 (OpenShift)
            - U36-37: wow-ts01 (TrueNAS Scale 25.10 - Supermicro 6028U-TR4T+)
    - **Network Device Access Configured**:
        - ✅ pfSense: sre-bot user with SSH key (id_pfsense_sre), read-only access
        - ✅ Cisco SG300-28: sre-bot user created (IP: 172.16.100.50 via Cisco web UI at 10.1.1.2)
            - Note: SSH key auth failed (SG300 doesn't support ED25519, RSA also rejected - firmware quirk)
            - Fallback: Password authentication configured for sre-bot
        - ✅ MikroTik CRS317: Accessible at http://172.16.100.50/ (RouterOS web UI)
            - Access pending: Need to configure sre-bot user with API access
    - **IP Inventory Analysis Complete**:
        - Documented all 6 VLANs: 100 (Apps), 110 (Proxmox Mgmt), 120 (Reserved), 130 (Workload), 160 (Storage), 10.1.1.0/24 (pfSense Mgmt)
        - ~40 active hosts across networks
        - MetalLB pools identified and documented (must protect from manual allocation)
        - 4 VMs on wrong network (VLAN 110) need migration to Apps network
        - Unknown hosts discovered: 172.16.100.54, 55, 79 (DHCP clients)
    - **Nautobot API Integration**:
        - ✅ API token retrieved from Bitwarden (WOW_NB_API_TOKEN)
        - ✅ DNS updated: ipmgmt.sigtom.dev → 172.16.100.10 (Traefik)
        - ✅ HTTPS working through Traefik with valid SSL
        - ⚠️ Python automation script created but hit API compatibility issues:
            - Nautobot 3.x uses different API structure (locations vs sites)
            - Device types require "model" as lookup field, not "name"
            - Roles require content_types field
            - Location hierarchy constraints (Datacenter can't have parent)
            - Script needs refactoring for Nautobot 3.x API schema
    - **Automation Strategy Defined**:
        - **Phase 1 (Next Session)**: Physical hierarchy in Nautobot via web UI
            - Create Tampa → WOW-DC → RACK 1
            - Add all devices with correct rack positions
            - Document Dell FX2s with 4 blades
        - **Phase 2**: Network discovery automation
            - pfSense: Pull DHCP leases, interface configs, ARP table via SSH
            - Mikrotik: Query via RouterOS API for interface status, routing table
            - Cisco: SSH scraping for interface status, MAC table (password auth)
            - Sync to Nautobot automatically
        - **Phase 3**: Proxmox/Ansible integration
            - Modify provision_lxc_generic and provision_vm_generic roles
            - Query Nautobot for next available IP before provisioning
            - Auto-register new VMs/LXCs in Nautobot after creation
            - Update Nautobot when VMs/LXCs are destroyed
        - **Phase 4**: IP address import
            - Parse automation/IP-INVENTORY.md
            - Bulk import all known IPs into Nautobot
            - Tag appropriately (dhcp, reserved, metallb, openshift, proxmox)
            - Assign IPs to device interfaces
    - **Files Created**:
        - automation/cisco-ssh-user.png - Screenshot of SSH user config attempt
        - automation/cisco-error.png - Screenshot of "Invalid key string" error
        - /tmp/nautobot_setup_complete.py - Physical infrastructure setup script (needs API fixes)
        - ~/.ssh/id_cisco_sre - RSA key for Cisco (rejected by SG300 firmware)
    - **Next Session Tasks**:
        1. Use Nautobot web UI to create physical hierarchy (faster than debugging API)
        2. Configure MikroTik sre-bot user with API access
        3. Test pfSense SSH access and pull interface/DHCP data
        4. Create network interface objects on all devices
        5. Document physical cable connections between devices
        6. Begin IP address import from IP-INVENTORY.md

- [2026-01-11]: **AUTOMATION PATTERN STANDARDIZATION & BITWARDEN LITE DEPLOYMENT (90% COMPLETE - ON HOLD)**
    - **Documentation Created**:
        - `automation/DEPLOYMENT-PATTERN.md` - Comprehensive deployment standard documentation
        - Mandatory two-play architecture (prevents Ansible fact caching bugs)
        - Cattle infrastructure pattern enforcement
        - Common mistakes and troubleshooting guide
        - Reference: Traefik deployment as gold standard template
    - **GitHub Issues Created**:
        - Issue #15: Ansible deprecation warning (INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS - need to migrate to ansible_facts dict)
        - Issue #16: health_check role cloud-init check inappropriate for LXC containers
    - **Bitwarden Lite Deployment Status**:
        - **Infrastructure**: ✅ COMPLETE
            - LXC 216 @ 172.16.100.16 (corrected from 172.16.100.106 which conflicted with OpenShift Apps VIP)
            - SSH authentication working with id_pfsense_sre key
            - Docker 29.1.4 + Docker Compose v2 installed
        - **Application**: ✅ RUNNING
            - Bitwarden Lite container deployed and healthy
            - All services operational: Identity, API, Admin, Icons, Notifications, nginx
            - SQLite database initialized at /etc/bitwarden/vault.db
            - Health endpoint responding: http://172.16.100.16:8080/alive
        - **Traefik Integration**: ✅ CONFIGURED (staging certs)
            - Config deployed: /opt/traefik/config/bitwarden.yml
            - Accessible at: https://bitvault.sigtom.dev
            - Using Let's Encrypt STAGING certificates (intentional - Cloudflare token security)
        - **Secrets Management**: ✅ WORKING
            - Installation ID/Key from https://bitwarden.com/host/ injected via environment variables
            - settings.env template working correctly with env_file in docker-compose
    - **Critical Lessons Learned**:
        - **IP Allocation**: MUST query Nautobot or IP inventory BEFORE provisioning (discovered 172.16.100.106 was OpenShift Apps VIP)
        - **Docker Compose env_file**: Don't mix `env_file:` with `environment:` using `${VAR}` substitution - env_file passes vars directly to container
        - **SSH Key Upload**: Fixed provision_lxc_generic role - replaced broken heredoc Jinja loop with ansible.builtin.copy + scp pattern
        - **Traefik Wildcard Certs**: Use `tls: {}` in router config to leverage existing wildcard cert, not `certResolver:` which requests new cert
    - **Bugs Fixed**:
        - provision_lxc_generic role: SSH key upload Jinja syntax error in heredoc (replaced with copy + scp)
        - snapshot_manager role: Recursive loop in pve_api_user variable lookup (disabled snapshots temporarily)
        - Bitwarden docker-compose.yml: Removed duplicate env var declarations causing "variable not set" warnings
        - Bitwarden image name: Corrected to `ghcr.io/bitwarden/lite` (no version tag per official docs)
    - **Deployment Files Created**:
        - `automation/playbooks/deploy-bitwarden-lite.yaml` - Full two-play deployment (follows Traefik pattern)
        - `automation/templates/bitwarden/docker-compose.yml` - Bitwarden Lite stack
        - `automation/templates/bitwarden/settings.env.j2` - Environment variables template
        - `automation/templates/bitwarden/traefik-bitwarden.yml.j2` - Traefik integration config

- [2026-01-11]: **EXTERNAL SECRETS OPERATOR & BITWARDEN INTEGRATION (COMPLETE)**
    - **Goal**: Enable GitOps-driven secrets management using External Secrets Operator (ESO) pulling from self-hosted Bitwarden Lite.
    - **Challenge**: OLM installation of ESO failed due to version conflicts. Official Bitwarden provider requires paid "Secrets Manager" product.
    - **The SRE Pivot**: 
        - Bypassed OLM entirely.
        - Deployed ESO `v1.2.1` (Upstream) via "Hydrated Helm" pattern (GitOps managed).
        - Deployed `bitwarden-eso-provider` (Community Bridge) to interface with Bitwarden Vault API.
    - **Architecture**: 
        - **Engine**: ESO v1.2.1 running in `external-secrets` namespace.
        - **Bridge**: `bitwarden-eso-provider` pod acting as a webhook provider.
        - **Store**: `ClusterSecretStore/bitwarden-login` configured to talk to the Bridge.
    - **Critical Technical Fixes**:
        - **CRD Size Limit**: Enabled `ServerSideApply=true` in ArgoCD Application to handle 256KB+ CRDs (etcd limit).
        - **OpenShift Security**: Removed hardcoded `runAsUser: 1000` from manifests (`securityContext: null`) to allow SCC defaults.
        - **Container Permissions**: Injected `HOME=/tmp` into provider pod to fix `mkdir /.config` permission denied error (random UID support).
        - **Configuration**: Added missing `BW_APPID` to SealedSecret to satisfy provider config requirement.
    - **Outcome**: 
        - ESO Operator: **Running**
        - Bitwarden Provider: **Running**
        - ClusterSecretStore: **Valid/Ready**
    - **Next Steps**:
        - Create `ExternalSecret` resources to consume actual secrets.
        - Deploy Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) leveraging these secrets.
