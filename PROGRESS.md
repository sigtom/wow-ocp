- [2025-12-22]: Switched `rdt-client` provider to TorBox to resolve Zurg/Real-Debrid sync and symlink issues.
- [2025-12-22]: Updated `zurg` configuration to improve compatibility with `rdt-client` (retain names, auto-delete RARs) for legacy library access.
- [2025-12-22]: Confirmed `rclone-torbox` mount is active and populating new downloads in Plex.
- [2025-12-22]: **CRITICAL FIX**: Pinned `rdt-client`, `sonarr`, `radarr`, and `plex` to `wow-ocp-node4`.
- [2025-12-22]: Verified end-to-end flow with "Peacemaker S02E05" via TorBox -> rdt-client (Node 4) -> Symlink -> Plex (Node 4).
- [2025-12-23]: **ARCHITECTURAL UPGRADE**: Migrated entire media stack to Sidecar Pattern.
    - **Change**: Added `rclone-zurg` and `rclone-torbox` containers to every deployment (Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, Bazarr, Sabnzbd, Riven, Rdt-client).
    - **Result**: Resolved FUSE/NFS mount propagation issues. Apps no longer need to be pinned to a single node.
    - **Optimization**: Replaced hard `nodeSelector` with `nodeAffinity` (preferred) for Node 2 and 3 to utilize 10G NICs and superior CPU resources.
    - **Outcome**: Verified cross-pod mount consistency and successful deployment to Node 3 via ArgoCD.
- [2025-12-23]: **INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING**: Secured Cluster Application Domain.
    - **Change**: Requested Let's Encrypt Wildcard Certificate for `*.apps.ossus.sigtomtech.com` via Cert-Manager (DNS-01).
    - **Action**: Patched `IngressController/default` to use the new certificate as the default for all system routes.
    - **Result**: Successfully replaced self-signed certificates for OpenShift Console, ArgoCD, and all apps. "Green Lock" is now active cluster-wide.
- [2025-12-31]: **MAJOR CLUSTER RECOVERY & GITOPYS REALIGNMENT**:
    - **Storage**: Resolved LVM operator deadlock on Node 4 by manually removing stale thin pools and dependent volumes (MCE).
    - **Storage**: Successfully initialized LVM Volume Groups across all blades (Node 2, 3, 4) for the first time.
    - **GitOps**: Aligned `LVMCluster` manifest in Git with hardware-specific `by-path` IDs and `optionalPaths` to resolve persistent ArgoCD Sync errors.
    - **Virtualization**: Repaired Node Feature Discovery (NFD) crash loop by removing hardcoded operand images. Verified hardware VMX detection and enabled `kubevirt.io/schedulable` across the cluster.
    - **Monitoring**: Resolved Prometheus `CrashLoopBackOff` caused by "disk quota exceeded." Increased storage from 20Gi to 100Gi via GitOps and triggered PVC expansion on TrueNAS.
    - **Media Stack**: Fixed missing media mounts in Sonarr, Overseerr, and Prowlarr by adding `/mnt/media` parent mount and `rclone` sidecars. Verified cross-pod mount visibility for Cloud (Zurg/TorBox) and Local storage.
    - **Security**: Rotated leaked GitOps token, hardened `.gitignore`, and cleaned up dangling branches.
    - **Maintenance**: Merged `feature/add-apprise-mailrise` into `main` and normalized all ArgoCD applications to track `HEAD`. Cluster is now "All Green" with zero alerts.
